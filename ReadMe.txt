***This readme is to give info as to the updates that happen to the files in this repository.
2/14/2017 - Sam added updated hardware files to fix the duplicate data issue with the data stream. 
2/14/2017 - Graham added updated devkit software files which takes data directly from the DRAM, processes it, and saves it to the SD card.
The data are saved in binary format and may be converted to text format with my program called bin_to_text on the shared drive.
